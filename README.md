This bar chart shows the distribution of sales across different branches (A, B, and C) of the supermarket. Each branch has a similar number of sales transactions, indicating a fairly even distribution of sales activities across all branches. This suggests that no single branch significantly outperforms the others in terms of the number of sales transactions.

This line chart shows the total sales trend over time. The x-axis represents the date, and the y-axis represents the total sales amount. The sales trend appears to be quite volatile, with significant fluctuations over the observed period. This volatility could be due to various factors such as promotions, holidays, or seasonal changes affecting customer buying behavior.

4. Correlation Matrix

The correlation matrix heatmap shows the relationships between different numerical variables in the dataset. The colors indicate the strength and direction of the correlations, with red representing strong positive correlations and blue representing weak or negative correlations. Key observations include:

A strong positive correlation between Tax 5%, Total, and cogs (cost of goods sold), which makes sense as higher costs lead to higher taxes and totals.
Unit price and Quantity have a weak correlation, suggesting that unit prices do not strongly influence the quantity purchased.
Rating has very weak correlations with other variables, indicating that customer ratings might be influenced by factors not directly captured in the dataset.
